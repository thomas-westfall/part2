##Commentary by Eve Ali (E-Allie)

Overall, running it simply printed text without lines, as compared to fully formatting, or even testing (it appeared to test Task A, it didn't truly).

The countChar function theoretically would have worked.
It was, however, untested.

Some style choices were a bit odd, such as unnecessary multiple loops.
Also, using namespace std.
